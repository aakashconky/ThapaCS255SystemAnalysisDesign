# ThapaCS255SystemAnalysisDesign

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The purpose of this project is to create an interface in the form of a website that helps future drivers to be able to take online classes, practice tests, and schedule on-the road-training. The main aim here is to help people from failing their driving tests by providing better training. 
The client here is DriverPass, and Liam is the owner of it.  
The client wants us to build a system that allows their customers to enroll in an online class, practice test, and schedule on-the-road training.

What did you do particularly well?

I did well on the business requirement document and on UML diagrams.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would want to spend more time on UML diagrams or on the process to make it better or more detailed. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user must be comfortable using the interface, this is very important thing to consider. The system was designed to make complicate things simple. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I would like to use UML diagrams. I understand more clearly with UML digarams. Also the business document is the basic requirement.
